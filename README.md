# pcmd
pcmd is a simple command line tool to run commands on multiple remote servers in parallel.It uses SSH connection to connect the servers so no agent is required. SSH authentication should be taken care prior running this tool using SSH keys.

Below a simple example shows how we can get DNS server details from two remote servers.

create a file called nodelist in the same directory with all your server names. (Assuming servers are configured with password less SSH)

now simple run pcmd.py as below

```
[root@localhost pcmd]# more nodelist 
k8s-node1
k8s-node2
[root@localhost pcmd]# 
[root@localhost pcmd]# ./pcmd.py "cat /etc/resolv.conf"

2019-05-05 18:12:03   [SUCCESS]  SSH connectivity k8s-node2
2019-05-05 18:12:03   [SUCCESS]  Command execution on k8s-node2
